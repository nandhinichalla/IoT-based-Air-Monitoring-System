CONNECTIONS 

1. Connect DHT11 Sensor to ESP8266: 
-> Connect the VCC pin of the DHT11 to the 3.3V pin on the ESP8266. 
-> Connect the GND pin of the DHT11 to the GND pin on the ESP8266. 
-> Connect the data pin (out) of the DHT11 to, for example, GPIO pin D4 on the 
ESP8266.
 
2. Connect MQ-135 Gas Sensor to ESP8266: 
-> Connect the VCC pin of the MQ-135 to the 5V pin on the ESP8266. 
-> Connect the GND pin of the MQ-135 to the GND pin on the ESP8266. 
-> Connect the analog output pin (AO) of the MQ-135 to, for example, analog 
pin A0 on the ESP8266.
 
3. Connect I2C LCD 16x2 Display to ESP8266: 
-> Connect the VCC pin of the LCD to the 5V pin on the ESP8266. 
-> Connect the GND pin of the LCD to the GND pin on the ESP8266. 
-> Connect the SDA pin of the LCD to, for example, GPIO pin D2 on the ESP8266. 
-> Connect the SCL pin of the LCD to, for example, GPIO pin D1 on the ESP8266. 

4. Uploading the Code: 
-> Connect the ESP8266 to your computer via USB. 
-> Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE. 
-> Upload the code to the ESP8266. 
Ensure that the power requirements of the sensors (DHT11 and MQ-135) and the LCD 
are met. 
Double-check the pin configurations of your specific sensors, as they may vary. 
Use jumper wires to establish connections between the components on the 
breadboard. 
Verify that the I2C address of your LCD matches the address in the code (0x27 is a 
common default address). 
Always power off the system before making or modifying connections.
