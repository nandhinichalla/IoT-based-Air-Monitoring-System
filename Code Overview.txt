Code Overview :

1. Libraries and Definitions: 
-> The code includes necessary libraries for ESP8266, Blynk, DHT (for the DHT11 
sensor), and LiquidCrystal_I2C (for the LCD). 
-> Definitions are set for Blynk template ID, device name, authentication token, 
and Wi-Fi credentials. 

2. LCD Configuration: 
-> The I2C LCD is configured with its address (0x27) and dimensions (16x2). 
-> A custom character is defined for the degree symbol. 

3. Blynk and Wi-Fi Configuration: 
-> Blynk authentication token, Wi-Fi SSID, and Wi-Fi password are configured. 
-> A BlynkTimer object is created for scheduling periodic tasks. 

4. Sensor and Display Initialization in setup(): 
-> Serial communication is initiated along with the Blynk connection, DHT sensor, 
and timer for periodic sensor readings. 
-> The LCD is initialized, and an introductory message is displayed. 

5. Sensor Reading Function: 
-> A function (sendSensor()) reads temperature, humidity, and gas values. 
-> The values are sent to corresponding virtual pins on Blynk.

6. Main Loop: 
-> The main loop continuously runs Blynk and timer tasks. 
-> Temperature and humidity are displayed on the LCD. 
-> Gas value is checked, and whether the air is fresh or bad is displayed on the 
LCD. 
-> A Blynk event log is triggered if the gas value indicates bad air.
