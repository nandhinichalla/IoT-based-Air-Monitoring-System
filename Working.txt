WORKING 

1. Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: 
-> Utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity in the 
surrounding environment. 
-> Displays the temperature in degrees Celsius on a 16x2 LCD with a 
custom degree symbol. 
-> Shows the humidity percentage on the same LCD display. 

2. Air Quality Monitoring: 
-> Incorporates an MQ-135 gas sensor to detect air quality based on the 
concentration of certain gases in the environment. 
-> The gas sensor readings are displayed on the LCD screen. 
-> If the gas concentration exceeds a predefined threshold (600 in the 
provided code), the LCD indicates "Bad Air." 

3. Remote Monitoring with Blynk: 
-> Integrates with the Blynk IoT platform for remote monitoring and 
control. 
-> Sends temperature, humidity, and gas values to the Blynk mobile app 
in real-time. 
-> Blynk app widgets visualize the data, allowing users to monitor air quality
 from anywhere with an internet connection. 

4. Alerts and Logging: 
-> Generates an event log on the Blynk app in case of bad air quality, 
triggering a pollution alert. 
-> This provides a historical record of pollution events, aiding in analysis 
and awareness. 

5. LCD Display for Local Visualization: 
-> The LCD screen serves as a local interface for immediate visual 
feedback on environmental conditions. 
-> It displays key information such as temperature, humidity, and air 
quality status. 

6. Customizable Thresholds and Configurations: 
-> The code includes threshold values that can be adjusted based on 
specific air quality standards or project requirements. 
-> Users can customize the code and configurations to suit their 
environmental monitoring needs. 

7. Continuous Monitoring and Timed Readings: 
-> The system continuously monitors environmental parameters using a 
BlynkTimer for timed sensor readings. 
-> Regular updates ensure that users have access to up-to-date 
information on temperature, humidity, and air quality. 

In summary, the project provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and 
visualizing key environmental parameters, offering both local and remote access to 
real-time data. It is suitable for applications where awareness of indoor or outdoor air 
quality is essential, such as smart home systems, environmental monitoring, or 
workplace safety initiatives.
