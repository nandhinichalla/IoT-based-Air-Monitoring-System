# IoT-based-Air-Monitoring-System
Developed an Internet of Things (IoT) based air quality monitoring system to track and report real-time environmental data, such as levels of pollutants (e.g., CO2, CO, PM2.5), temperature, and humidity. Integrated sensors to capture air quality parameters, and designed a wireless communication framework using microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino/Raspberry Pi) to send data to cloud servers for analysis and visualization. Implemented data dashboards for remote monitoring via mobile or web applications. Enhanced system efficiency with automated alerts for critical pollution levels and potential health risks
